        •	The Antikythera mechanism is an ancient Greek hand-powered orrery, described as the first
        analogue computer the oldest known example of such a device used to predict astronomical
        positions and eclipses for calendar and astrological purposes decades in advance. It could also
        be used to track the four-year cycle of athletic games which was similar to an Olympiad, the
        cycle of the ancient Olympic Games. 
        •	This artefact was retrieved from the sea in 1901, and identified on 17 May 1902 as 
        containing a gear by archaeologist Valerios Stais among wreckage retrieved from a shipwreck off
        the coast of the Greek island Antikythera. The instrument is believed to have been designed and
        constructed by Greek scientists and has been variously dated to about 87 BC, or between 150 and
        100 BC, or to 205 BC, or to within a generation before the shipwreck, which has been dated to
        approximately 70–60 BC</h3></b></i>
