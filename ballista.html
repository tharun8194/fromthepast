        •	The ballista plural ballistae, sometimes called bolt thrower, was an ancient missile weapon 
        that launched either bolts or stones at a distant target.
        •	Developed from earlier Greek weapons, it relied upon different mechanics, using two levers
        with torsion springs instead of a tension prod (the bow part of a modern crossbow). The springs 
        consisting of several loops of twisted skeins. Early versions projected heavy darts or spherical
        stone projectiles of various sizes for siege warfare. It developed into a smaller precision 
        weapon, the scorpio, and possibly the polybolos.</h3></i></b></p align="center">
