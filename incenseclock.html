        â€¢	The incense is an Indian timekeeping device that was popularised by China during the Song
        Dynasty (960-1279) and spread to neighboring East Asian countries such as Japan and Korea. The
        clocks' bodies are effectively specialized censers that hold incense sticks or powdered incense
        that have been manufactured and calibrated to a known rate of combustion, used to measure 
        minutes, hours, or days. The clock may also contain bells and gongs which act as strikers.
        Although the water clock and astronomical clock were known in China (example: Su Song), Incense
        clocks were commonly used at homes and temples in dynastic times.
