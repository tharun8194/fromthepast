        •	Greek fire was an incendiary weapon used by the Byzantine Empire beginning c. 672. 
        Used to set light to enemy ships, it consisted of a combustible compound emitted by a 
        flame-throwing weapon. Some historians believe it could be ignited on contact with water, 
        and was probably based on naphtha and quicklime. The Byzantines typically used it in naval
        battles to great effect, as it could continue burning while floating on water. The technological
        advantage it provided was responsible for many key Byzantine military victories, most notably
        the salvation of Constantinople from the first and second Arab sieges, thus securing the Empire's 
        survival.
        •	The impression made by Greek fire on the western European Crusaders was such that the name 
        was applied to any sort of incendiary weapon, including those used by Arabs, the Chinese, and 
        the Mongols. However, these mixtures used formulas different from that of Byzantine Greek fire,
        which was a closely guarded state secret. Byzantines also used pressurized nozzles to project
        the liquid onto the enemy, in a manner resembling a modern flamethrower.</h3></i></b></p align="center">
