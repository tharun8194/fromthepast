        •	The fire lance is the ancestor of firearms. It was a gunpowder weapon that appeared in 
        10-12th century China and was used to great effect during the Jin-Song Wars. It began as a 
        small pyrotechnic device attached to a polearm weapon, used to gain a critical shock advantage
        right at the start of a melee. As gunpowder improved, the explosive discharge was increased, 
        and debris or pellets added, giving it some of the effects of a combination modern flamethrower 
        and shotgun, but with a very short range (about 3 meters or 10 feet), and only one shot 
        (some were designed for two shots). By the late 13th century, fire lance barrels had 
        transitioned to metal material to better withstand the explosive blast, and the lance-point
        was discarded in favor of relying solely on the gunpowder blast. These became the first hand
        cannons. 
        •	The first fire lances consisted of a tube, usually bamboo, containing gunpowder and a slow
        match, strapped to a spear or other polearm weapon. Once ignited, the gunpowder tube would 
        ideally eject a stream of flames in the direction of the spearhead. Projectiles such as iron
        pellets or pottery shards were later added to the gunpowder. Upon firing, the gunpowder charge 
        ejected the projectiles along with the flame.
