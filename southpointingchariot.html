        •	The south-pointing chariot (or carriage) was an ancient Chinese two-wheeled vehicle that
        carried a movable pointer to indicate the south, no matter how the chariot turned. Usually, 
        the pointer took the form of a doll or figure with an outstretched arm. The chariot was 
        supposedly used as a compass for navigation and may also have had other purposes.
        •	The ancient Chinese invented a mobile-like armored cart in the 5th century BC   
        called the Dongwu Che It was used for the purpose of protecting warriors on the battlefield.
        The Chinese war wagon was designed as a kind of mobile protective cart with a shed-like roof. 
        It would serve to be rolled up to city fortifications to provide protection for sappers digging
        underneath to weaken a wall's foundation. The early Chinese war wagon became the basis of 
        technologies for the making of ancient Chinese south-pointing chariots.
